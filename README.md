### Strategies for Building Skills & Becoming More Desirable to Employers.
1. Revamp your online Presence. Update your profiles across LinkedIn, GlassDoor, GitHub, Indeed and any other professional sites with UPDATED and COMPLETE information.
2. Search for job postings that speak to you. Maybe you are interested in Product Design or Product Management roles, but your experience and education is within Computer Science. For this, see *Strategies for Picking a Career Path* below. But, if you do know the direction, then ignore the rest focus on step 2 below.

### Strategies for Picking a Career Path
1. Maybe you are unsure on what you want to do with your life, and if you are unsure where you want to be in the future, something as simple as taking the next step can be overwhelming if you don't know in which direction to take it. 
  1. List out your mentors (direct or indirect). Who are they, what do they do, what industry are they in, etc? Once you answer this you should have a pretty good idea of where you want to head. Make note of their age as well, this can give you a realistic timeline for your own plans. 
  2. Do a search for these kinds of job postings.  Find as many postings as you can, and build a document containing all the unique qualifications, responsibilities and locations. Next, search on LinkedIn for people who occupy this role. Make note of their previous positions and experience, and copy this over to your document. This will give you a great idea as to what kind of career & education path is necessary. Find as many as you can. If your mentors are entrepreneurial figures, search for the knowledge and expertise these individuals currently posses, as well as their previous jobs and ventures. 
  2. Now, list out the skills, experience and education you possess that are in-demand to employers. Identify any overlap between where you are now, and where you want to be. (Perhaps there is none, perhaps you went to college for something you don't really care for, or perhaps you've gotten sick of your current industry. This is ok, but it means you might need to take a job you don't care for to pay the bills while you work on fulfilling your passion in your free-time.)
  3. This next step likely requires some sacrifice of your desires for what is possible and logical. Your goal now is to draft a rough map of how to get from point A to point B. What tools, industries and experience do you need? What connections do you need to make? Do you need to move to somewhere more central/connected? Etc. Now you have to pick a direction for your next-step, what is the optimal job for you to take to fast-track your way to point B. You might not like it, and you especially might not like the pay, but this is why it will take sacrifice. You want to focus on learning as much as you can as quickly as you can. 
  4. Do periodic check-ins. Are you on track? Are you advancing your skillset? Are you one step closer to your goal? If not, fix it.
